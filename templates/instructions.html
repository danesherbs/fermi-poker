            <b>Objective:</b> The goal of Fermi Poker is to solve a Fermi problem as accurately as possible.
        </div>
        <div>
            Here are the rules:
        </div>
        <div>
            1. <b>Estimating:</b> There are two players and only one player makes an estimate at a time. The
            estimator must guess the answer to a Fermi problem. For instance, if the problem is "What's the average
            number of hairs on a person's head?", you might guess 10^(6 +/- 2). This estimate is correct since the true
            average number of hairs on a human head is 10^6 which is in the range of 10^4 to 10^8.
        </div>
        <div>
            2. <b>Payouts:</b> After an estimate is made, the other player pays the estimator if the estimate is correct
            (i.e., the true answer lies within the error bounds of the estimate). If the estimate is incorrect (i.e.,
            the true answer lies outside the error bounds), the estimator pays the other player.
        </div>
        <div>
            3. <b>Payout size:</b> The size of the payout is inversely proportional to the error.
            <ul class="list-disc ml-8 mt-4">
                <li>If your error was small and your estimate was correct, you receive a large payout.</li>
                <li>If your error was small but your estimate was incorrect, you pay a large amount.</li>
                <li>If your error was large but your estimate was correct, you receive a small payout.</li>
                <li>If your error was large and your estimate was incorrect, you pay a small amount.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div>
            Remember, the goal in Fermi Poker is not only to make correct estimates but also to be as precise as
            possible. The more precise your estimates, the more you stand to winâ€”or lose. Good luck and happy
            estimating!
