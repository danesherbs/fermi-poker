            <p><b>Objective:</b> Win the most chips by making accurate estimates and strategic bets. Players take turns making Fermi
                estimates and betting on the accuracy of these estimates, similar to poker.</p>

            <h3 class="font-bold mb-2">How to Play</h3>
        
            <ol class="space-y-4">
                <li>
                    <b>Taking Turns:</b> In this two-player game, you'll alternate roles as the estimator and the bettor. When
                    you're the estimator, you'll answer a Fermi question like "What's the average number of hairs on a person's
                    head?"
                </li>
        
                <li>
                    <b>Making Your Estimate:</b> Express your answer using scientific notation in the form of 10^(x ± y), where:
                    <ul class="list-disc ml-6 mt-2">
                        <li>x is your central estimate (the exponent of 10)</li>
                        <li>y is your uncertainty range (in orders of magnitude)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="mt-2 italic">Example: If you estimate 1,000,000 hairs with an uncertainty of 2 orders of
                        magnitude, enter 10^(6 ± 2). This means your estimate ranges from 10^4 (10,000) to 10^8 (100,000,000).
                    </p>
                </li>
        
                <li>
                    <b>Betting Round:</b> After the estimate is made:
                    <ul class="list-disc ml-6 mt-2">
                        <li>The non-estimating player starts by calling, raising, or folding</li>
                        <li>If they raise, the estimator can then call or fold</li>
                        <li>Betting continues until both players have called or someone folds</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
        
                <li>
                    <b>Determining Accuracy:</b> The true answer is revealed after betting concludes:
                    <ul class="list-disc ml-6 mt-2">
                        <li>If the true answer falls within your estimated range, your estimate is accurate</li>
                        <li>If the true answer is outside your range, your estimate is inaccurate</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
        
                <li>
                    <b>Payout Structure:</b> The payout depends on both accuracy and precision:
                    <ul class="list-disc ml-6 mt-2">
                        <li><b>Accurate estimate with narrow range (small y):</b> Highest payout</li>
                        <li><b>Accurate estimate with wide range (large y):</b> Lower payout</li>
                        <li><b>Inaccurate estimate with narrow range:</b> Largest loss</li>
                        <li><b>Inaccurate estimate with wide range:</b> Smaller loss</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="mt-2">If either player folds, the remaining player wins the current pot.</p>
                </li>
        
                <li>
                    <b>Winning the Game:</b> Play continues for an agreed-upon number of rounds. The player with the most chips
                    at the end wins!
                </li>

            <h3 class="font-bold mb-2">Strategic Tips</h3>
            <ul class="list-disc ml-6">
                <li>Balance precision with accuracy — narrower ranges (smaller y values) yield higher rewards but carry greater
                    risk</li>
                <li>Consider the difficulty of the question when deciding your uncertainty range</li>
                <li>Watch your opponent's betting patterns to gauge their confidence</li>
